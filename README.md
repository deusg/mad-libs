# Mad Libs
This Python script implements a simple mad lib generator. Mad libs are a type of word game where players fill in the blanks of a provided story with their own words, typically based on specified categories like nouns, adjectives, and verbs.

The script begins by prompting the user to input various words or phrases, including an object in the room, a preferred type of food, a favorite color, and the name of a zoo animal. These inputs are stored in variables for later use.

Using string interpolation (formatted strings), the script constructs a sentence using the user-provided inputs. The sentence describes a whimsical scenario where the specified zoo animal jumps onto the named object, flies across the city, and enjoys the user's preferred food at its favorite restaurant.

Finally, the constructed sentence is printed to the console, allowing the user to see the amusing result of their inputs.

Overall, this script provides a fun and interactive way for users to create their own unique stories by filling in the blanks with their imagination.
