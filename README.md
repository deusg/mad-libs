# Mad Libs
This Python script is a mad lib generator, a word game where users input words or phrases to complete a story template. It prompts users for inputs like objects, foods, colors, and animals, then constructs a sentence using their inputs. Finally, it prints the amusing sentence to the console, providing an interactive and creative experience for users.

## Credits
This project was inspired by the book "_Creative Coding in Python_" (Chapter 1, Page 32).
